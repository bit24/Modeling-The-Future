# Modeling Corn
This respository contains most of the code used in Team 10% Rule's 2nd Place submission for the 2020 Modeling The Future Challenge. We analyzed the effect of climate change on the agricultural industry and made predictions until the year 2050.

In short, we used regression techinques to analyze the relationship between climate variables and insurance losses, and then used Monte Carlo simulations to extrapolate to the future.
